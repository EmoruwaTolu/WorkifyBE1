// For guidance take a look at events.js
// The table in Events.js refers to the database you will be sending information to
// The table you should use for this is StudentAccounts
// The database should store data such as FirstName, LastName, Email, and password

// 1. Create an API that creates a user in the database
// 1. Create an API that validates whether data(email and password) a user in the database actually exists.
// For the second API you should have appropriate response messages if it fails, i.e user does not exist or incorrect password

// You know where to find me if you need more info
// I heavily recommend trying to figure it out yourself before using ChatGPT, I think I've documented the code well enough but you can always message me about something that's confusing
